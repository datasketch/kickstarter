After some research we decided to go for GMass.

It allows to send Merge email connecting straight in your email inbox. You can make searches and select all relevan contacts. You can also connect to a google sheet and import all your contacts. 

GMass will send an email as if you did it one by one, it will also append it to the thread of your contacts so you have a more natural converstion flow.

You can customize replies depending on wether your contacts open your email or not.
