For a while now I have been looking to have our own url shortener.

We went for bit.ly, only because I met [Hilary Mason](https://twitter.com/hmason) in NYC some years ago, when she was still working there.

I bought the domain **dskt.ch** for datasketch. I couldn't buy a shorter one, but this one still works, it was only $15 USD and might also help some friends remember how to spell DataSKTeCH.

Unfortunately I came up with the idea to have a custom domain for the short links only after I sent the personal invitations before launch. So most signups during the first week will come a single direct link http://bit.ly/save-the-data
