This post is the ultimate guide to launch a (un)successfull kickstarter campaign (only time will tell).

Our campaign (#SaveTheData)[https://dskt.ch/2Zyk13m] launched on August 27th, 2019.

Check out [this page](how-to-updates) for updates on important events during the 39 days or our campaign.


We are writing this post live as we implement our campaign. Why is it called Perimortem?. Because it is a "during mortem" post. See it live!

The full history of the documented learnings is here in our [github repo](http://github.com/datasketch/kickstarter))
