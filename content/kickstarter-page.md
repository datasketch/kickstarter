Difficult problems require difficult data
Demand for data scientists
Collaboration

After X years all the pieces came together into datasketch apps


We want to empower communities and organizations through Data Apps that will allow them to clean, organize, visualize and share their data. Through our Open Data repository, anyone will be able to share and access hard-to-find information. This is the beginning of a data revolution which will allow making informed and evidence-based decisions.



We are doing this because, we want to live in a world where:

- Data can be user for good
- 

## Why should I care about your data apps 

There are many other visualization tools out there, in fact you can check them all here [http://datasketch.co/tools](http://datasketch.co/tools)


## What are our Data Apps

Small organizations, no need to overkill?
Free and open source
Access to data


With our data app you can browse our apps and select the one that best suits your needs. Inside each app you can check out our open data directory, use data shared by other users or even upload your own data. You can customize it with titles, legends and use different themes. Additionally the app recommends other visualization types and even gives you tips to learn more about data visualization. The code used with our apps is open source, so you can deploy your own and even adapt them for your specific needs. You can export visualizations in multiple formats.




## And we need your help to scale it

More languages
More local and meaningful apps
More connectors to open data sources


We will make our data tools available for more users, especially those in developing economies to empower them to tackle difficult issues. With your support we’ll build 30 more data apps, improve user experience, documentation, and support two new languages: French and Portuguese.
